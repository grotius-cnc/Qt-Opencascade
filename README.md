# Qt-Opencascade
Qt Opencascade templates for c++ and qml. 

#### The c++ project is quite straight on. No tricks are used to get it running. It has a 3d view box, mouse- and keyboard tracking. It's a full options starting point.

#### The qml project is build up from the above c++ project and needed a few opengl redefinings to get it running. 
#### For qml coders, this is the perfect qml-opencascase starting point. I hope you enjoy it, and understand the code examples after you studied them.

The c++ and qml project archives are in the release page, links :
